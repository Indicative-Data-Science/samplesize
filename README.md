# samplesize
Work to investigate the effect of sample size on efficiency of GNSS mapping algorithm.
Requires gnssmapper package
Sourcecode comprises 3 scripts:
- metrics.py  - sample size metrics and relationship with algorithm accuracy
- freespace.py - Efficiency of data collection across time and space for the scenario of an idealised standalone simple building.
- scenarios.py - extends efficiency studies to real physical scenarios.
